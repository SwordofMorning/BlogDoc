## §2 Postscript

&emsp;&emsp;My blog has been migrated and was not originally published in Markdown format on GitHub. If you encounter a `.md` file that contains a significant amount of HTML, it indicates that the document was created before 2021 and was converted from Markdown to HTML when exported from WordPress. For the most accurate representation, please visit my blog.

&emsp;&emsp;In some cases, there may be two versions of a blog post, with one version bearing the suffix `release`. Typically, the `release` version is intended for publication on my blog and includes modifications to LaTeX formulas. For example, `**lr**` might be altered to `\*\*lr\*\*`, and `A_{ij}` to `A\_{ij}`. This is necessary because my blog's editor supports both Markdown and MathJax (LaTeX) parsing, requiring special characters in Markdown to be escaped with `\`.
