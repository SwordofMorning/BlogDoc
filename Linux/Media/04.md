# Linux Media 04 Sound Card Architecture

[toc]

&emsp;&emsp;In the article, we'll learn some basic knowledge about sound card and Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.

## ยง1 Wave

&emsp;&emsp;Before we discuss sound card or Linux software, we need to clarify what is sound. From the point of view of physics, **sound is a** vibration that propagates as an acoustic **wave**, through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid. Sound can propagate through a medium such as air, water and solids as <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_wave">longitudinal waves</a> and also as a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_wave">transverse wave</a> in solids. 

&emsp;&emsp;Sound waves are often simplified to a description in terms of sinusoidal plane waves, which are characterized by these generic properties:

1. Frequency, or it's inverse, wavelength. 
2. Amplitude, sound pressure or Intensity
3. Speed of sound.
4. Direction.

Transverse waves, also known as shear waves, have the additional property, polarization, and are not a characteristic of sound waves.

&emsp;&emsp;Here we only discuss **frequency** and **amplitude**. *Frequency* determine how high or low the *pitch* is. *Amplitude* determine how hight or low the *volume* is. But if we want to save sound signal into the computer, we need to convert this wave from continuous analog signal to discrete digital signal. This conversion is usually divided into two steps, one is **signal sampling**, and the other is **data conversion**. 

&emsp;&emsp;There are two metrics to measure the quality of sampling.

1. Sampling Rate, refers to how many sound samples the computer collects per second. Be careful, **sampling rate** is different from wave's **frequency**. But there is still some correlations, eg. Nyquist frequency
.
2. Bits, This parameter indicates the accuracy with which the computer measures the amplitude (volume) of the sound waveform, which is commonly referred to as the bits of the sound card. The more bits, the higher the quality of the sound.

&emsp;&emsp;After sampling and conversion, the `.wav` file could save in computer, and this is much like the raw data of an image, which is uncompressed data. Correspondingly, the relationship between **mp3 and wav** is equivalent to the relationship between **jpeg and raw**.

## ยง2 MIDI

I'm trying to record an audio file via arecord on embeded Linux, but the file is blank. In Audacity, it looks like this:

[![The audio file's wave][1]][1]

But I could play ordinary audio file via aplay. I use RK809 as the sound card, which is connected to the cpu via I2S. There is an analog microphone connected to RK809, and the analog audio is processed by RK809 and transmitted to CPU through I2S bus.

Here is some information about it:

Here is what I've tried:

1. Record at least 10 seconds to make sure it's not I/O error.
2. Check the hardware. I checked MIC, but it's hard for me to check I2S bus, because to measure the I2S signal, you can only directly measure the pins of the chip. 

The following is the method suggested by the chip manufacturer, but I don't know how to implement it:

1. *"Use amixer or tinymix to check if the ADC channel inside the CODEC is open and the volume is muted."* In alsamixer, i'm sure the Capture MIC Path is not off, and Digital is not muted. I don't know how to check ADC's status.
2. *"Codec end input a 10k Hz wave signal which is produced by signal generator."* Is this means send sigal on I2S bus?
3. *"Use arecord or tinycap to record, whether the positioning problem occurs in user mode or kernel mode."* I use command `arecord -D hw:0,0 -d 2 -f cd -c 2 -vv -t wav test.wav
` to record, but generating a blank file.
