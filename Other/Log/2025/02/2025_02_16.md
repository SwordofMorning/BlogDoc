Following an extended hiatus, I resumed my professional duties on February 10th. I have been immersing myself in the intricate task of refactoring video output functionality through DRM implementation, a function previously realized through Rockchip's proprietary VO encapsulation. The decision to undertake this refactoring endeavor stemmed from the VO's propensity to generate glitch, an unacceptable phenomenon for a gas detection apparatus.

In a parallel development, my ex-gf dispatched several messages on February 8th that intimated (or perhaps this was merely my wishful interpretation) her desire to rekindle our erstwhile closeness. After protracted deliberations, we reached a mutual accord whereby I would return home for the weekend, as she expressed a desire to convey certain matters in person. The ensuing week proved to be an exercise in emotional endurance, complicated by her predilection for ambiguous communication. Our Saturday rendezvous encompassed visits to the local park and our alma mater, during which we engaged in extensive discourse on various subjects, conspicuously circumventing her actual thoughts. Upon my broaching the subjects of her pending Japanese work visa application, she divulged that the anxieties and complexities associated with envisioning a shared future with me substantially outweighed any accompanying anticipation. It hurts.
