Today I'm a little angry.

My dad took a wildcat home, though he have told me in two weeks ago that he wanted to took a cat, which was wandering in his workplace, home. I'm angry at we already have a black cat (called little black) at home, and the wildcat have not deworming and vaccinations, that may cause infection in little black.

Little black is a timid and sensitive cat, who even fear of mice and only could catch (hit) some cockroaches. I brought her home in March 2020, and I took care of her in the next few months due to the pandemic of COVID19, which cause I study my university course at home. After I returned to school, it was my dad who took care of little black for two years. Since I got my degree, I return my hometown and work here for over 2 years. One night in November 2023, I patted her while she was sleeping. Maybe she was sleeping too deeply, when I patted her, she suddenly shook and bit me. She bit me and made me bleed, I think she must have had a stress reaction because she usually bites people only gently. I received 4 injections of rabies immunoglobulin on my ring finger, two injections on my wrist and two injections on my shoulder, which cost me more than RMB 2,000 because the doctor recommended one injection per 10 kg. Together with the tetanus vaccine and follow-up vaccinations, the total cost was more than RMB 3,000.

Honestly, her character is not endearing at all, and she only comes to people when she needs food (snacks) or needs a massage. She doesn't like you hugging her, nor does she like sitting on someone's lap; if you want to give her a massage, she will either lie on your chest through the sheets (most likely with her butt facing you), or lie on the bed and let you sit next to her and pat her butt. When it comes to cat toys, she only likes the combination of feathers and bells; she also only likes laser pens with mouse patterns. She is obviously not interested in ordinary red dots, flowers, or five-pointed stars. Recently, because I play galgame all night, she often asks me to open the door and give her a massage in the middle of the night. I think this still affects my gaming experience.

Although it sounds like I said a lot of bad things about her, I still think I have an obligation to take good care of her because she is someone I brought home and we are family. My father took it home out of sympathy for the wild cat. Although he also considered Little Black's situation and took corresponding isolation measures, I still cannot accept this behavior that endangers Little Black's health. Although I really wanted to beat up my father and throw the stray cat out of the house, I couldn't do that because the house we lived in was not mine (it was his). Since I don't own any property, I can't take her anywhere else. The apartment I live in Chengdu is rented, and considering the landlord's feelings, it's not convenient for me to take her there. More importantly, my father brought the wild cat back when I was about to end my vacation and return to Chengdu for work, instead of at the beginning of my vacation, so I had more time to accompany little black. When I came home today and saw Little Black hiding behind the curtains in my room, I was really worried.

I don't like to say this, but I really don't like my father who is a stupid, irresponsible and overly compassionate bastard.
