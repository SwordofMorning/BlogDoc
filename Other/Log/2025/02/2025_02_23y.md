This marks the second week since my resumption of my professional duties. During this period, I devoted approximately half a day to encapsulating the VO functionality via DRM implementation. The remainder of the week was predominantly allocated to translating philosophical discourse from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Tuesday and Wednesday were dedicated to rendering Lacanian and Zizekian synopses into Chinese, integral components of my serise entitled "Modernity & Intimacy". Their perspective, particularly regarding libidinal theory, constitute a fundamental paradigm for conceptualizing intimacy within modern social framework. Thursday and Friday witness my commencement of translating Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason", a text I had previously perused several years prior, while simultaneously maintaining my blog entries. In my translation methodology, I elected to preserve certain terminology in their original English, Geek, or German forms (e.g., "à priori"), facilitating enhanced the comprehension compared to purely Chinese rendition and enabling precise differentiation between potentially ambiguous verbs such as "begins with" and "arises out of".

my quotidian existence has undergone two significant modifications. Primarily, I have augmented my gymnasium attendance frequency from thrice to quadrice weekly; my established routine of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday sessions focusing on pectoral, dorsal, and leg musculature has been supplemented with Saturday sessions dedicated to shoulder and arm conditioning. Secondarily, I have intensified my guitar practice regimen. Recently, I have become deeply engrossed in the compositions of Ryujin (alternatively known as GYZE), which has emerged as my preeminent melodic death metal ensemble since Alexi's departure. In juxtaposition with Children of Bodom, Ryujin's compositions incorporate neoclassical elements, thereby elevating their technical complexity. My concentrated efforts on "The Rising Dragon" have enabled me to execute the solo at 80 beats per minute, precisely half the original tempo of 160.

I have necessarily reduced my blog publication frequency due to temporal constraints. Henceforth, I shall limit my entries to weekly intervals or occasions of particular significance.
