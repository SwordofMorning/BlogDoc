I arose punctually, having consumed 3 melatonin capsules in the previous night. For my morning repast, I favored Jiangxiang flatbread, witch I procured, over chicken breast, accompanied by a brace of eggs and a cpu of coffee.

Today's undertaking encompassed not only the integration of temperature measurement but also the rectification of various system bugs. For the former, I implemented temperature measurement by invoking quadratic function fitting on each image point within two-level for loops. For the latter, I incorporated a new device interface, which is employed to power off these modules, an EVF utilized in antecedent products bereft of power control and timing control; I personally implemented these features for the current product, the gas detector.

Upon the culmination of my day's endeavors, I betook myself to the gymnasium to engage in the training of my dorsal musculature.

Midday sustenance consisted of curry spaghetti, while the evening repast comprised egg whites accompanied by half a baguette.
