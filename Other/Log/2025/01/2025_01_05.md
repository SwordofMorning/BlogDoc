With the impending release of Sid Meier's Civilization VII next mont, I revisited Civilization VI in the midnight hours. To speak candidly, the Civilization series is decidedly more accessible to "kids" than the offerings from Paradox, such as Civilization lacks the capacity for swift unit selection and overview via diverse lists. Thus I found myself downloading Imperator:Rome, a title I had explored in years past. Alas, while the game's tutorial is undoubtedly preferable to a complete absence thereof, it fails to provide a comprehensive introduction to the game's mechanics.

Moreover, I succumbed to the embrace of slumber for nearly the entirety of the day. Upon rousing myself, I partook of my midday repast while viewing a YouTube video, a Peking duck takeaway, as the hour was well past noon. Subsequently, I indulged in a siesta until 17:30. Thereafter, I cleansed myself in the shower, luxuriating in a bath. While immersed in the bathtub, I dedicated myself to the memorization of English vocabulary and viewed a single episode of the anime Shangri-La Frontier, season 2. My evening sustenance was procured from Burger King. Following this, in accordance with my established predilections, I engaged in the practice of the guitar.
