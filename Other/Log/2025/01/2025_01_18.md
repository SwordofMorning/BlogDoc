I abstained from frequenting the gymnasium on Friday due to the onerous nature of my work, which primarily encompassed the packaging of images and the uploading of SDKs. As an aside, 1/17 marked my ultimate workday of this Chinese year; I shall embark upon a hiatus until 2/10.

I betook myself to the gymnasium at 11:30 on Saturday, as the coaches were orchestrating a year-end soiree, precipitating their premature closure of the establishment at 14:00. Subsequent to my training, I laundered my garments and engaged in domestic chores. I availed myself of the high-speed railway to egress Chengdu and returned to my home at night.

Owing to my occupational transfer, I am presently employed in Chengdu. Nearly half a year has elapsed since my last homecoming to Deyang. Upon unfastening the door to my abode, I was immensely gratified to discover that my feline companion had not sequestered herself beneath the sofa. My father imparted to me his desire to adopt a stray cat; I find myself at a loss for words.
