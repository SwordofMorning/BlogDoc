On the inaugural day of my return to my hometown, I paid a visit to my grandparents. I partook of the midday and evening repasts with them, and I slumbered during the other hours of the day. I indulged in Civilization VI for a spell at night, and subsequently engaged in coding until 3:00. The ensuing days, I simply dozed during the daylight hours, betook myself to the gymnasium at the dinner hour, and consequently immersed myself in coding or gaming during the nocturnal hours.

I encountered my senior high school classmate post-exercise. It has been nigh on 3 years since our last rendezvous. We discoursed on the trivialities of recent years, as we transitioned from college students to members of the workforce. I perpetually hold the belief that nearly all Chinese individuals suffer from mental afflictions; the most prevalent types being paranoia and anxiety. My classmate, a 25-year-old gentleman, is endeavoring to secure a mortgage that exceeds our local average monthly salary by a factor of 200. His parents and employer furnished the down payment, amounting to nearly 1 million yuan, yet the mortgage (surpassing 1 million yuan) remains an astronomical sum, while his salary, with no other sources of income mentioned, stands at a mere 10k yuan, twice the average, once social security and income tax have been deducted, leaving a paltry 8k yuan. I harbor doubts about the sagacity of purchasing a residence at the present juncture.

Procuring a domicile, a vehicle, entering into matrimony, and producing offspring are typically the aspirations Chinese parents hold for their progeny. I opine that this is a pre-modern (or traditional) notion, which appears anachronistic as the nation undergoes modernization (bereft of the Enlightenment). A quintessential illustration is that the nurturing of children still falls upon the shoulders of the family, yet the parents of said children are often incapable of bearing the financial burden of child-rearing due to their demanding occupations, necessitating additional assistance from the children's grandparents. However, the intimate relationship (or marital bond) espoused by my classmate is neither the pre-modern family-to-family union nor the modern atomized individual-to-individual connection, but rather an amalgamation of pre-modern familial obligations and post-modern open relationships. I shall refrain from expounding excessively on my critique of the dearth of Enlightenment modernization in contemporary society. This segment concludes here.

Moreover, my ex-gf dispatched a message to me, conveying her intention to apply for a visa to labor in Japan. It appears that she desires to make my acquaintance prior to her departure, or perchance that is merely my own aspiration. To speak with candor, I am utterly bereft of notions regarding this matter. What pretext ought I to employ to arrange a meeting with her.
