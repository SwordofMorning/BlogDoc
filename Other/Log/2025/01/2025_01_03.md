Despite the arrival of Friday, I found it no less arduous to rouse myself from slumber at an early hour. For my morning repast, I eschewed the customary chicken breast in favor of procuring tow pieces of Jiangxiang flatbread and brace of eggs, which I accompanied with a cup of coffee.

I devoted my morning to refactoring my filter function using OpenCL. My endeavor was to supplant the mean filter with a binary filter, which would be invoke subsequent to the pseudo color function. The extent data format, NV12, proves unsuitable for the mean filter due to the compression of the chroma space (UV). Discerning the distinction between the filtered and unfiltered image proves challenging when filter is applied on solely to the luma (Y) space. Regrettably, the binary filter yields even less satisfactory result. I find myself uncertain as to the necessity of implementing the filter, given that the sensor (FPGA) already incorporates NUC.

Upon the conclusion of my labors at the noon, I made my way to Wanda Square to partake of my midday repast, which took the form of Chaoshou. I endeavored to update the image of the VoCs detector to facilitate the addition of the USB UMS feature. However, I encountered an impediment in the form of the disabling of ADB on the new image. Moreover, the absence of bother serial port for rebooting and accessible WiFi left my with no recourse but to disassemble the device.

Following the completion of my daily toil, I betook myself to the gymnasium to engage in physical exercise. In keeping with my established regimen, I focused my efforts on the training of my lower extremities.

For my evening meal, I consumed the curry spaghetti that had not eaten at noon.
