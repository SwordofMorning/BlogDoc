As usual, I found myself struggling to rouse from slumber, have indulged in the use of my smartphone late into the night. For today's morning repast, I procured a single baguette; half of which sufficed to state my hunger, accompanied by a cup of coffee.

I devoted my efforts to integrating the gas enhancement functionality, which had been previously implemented by the sensor (FPGA), into the gas detectors. The task proved relatively straightforward with the assistance of an algorithm engineer; the preponderance of our tie was spent on fine-tuning parameters rather than implementing the algorithm itself. With a high threshold, the gas was clearly discernible, while the noise was equally conspicuous. However, distinguishing between the gas and noise become increasingly challenging as we diminished the threshold. I posited that the addition of a BM3D post gas enhancement could prove beneficial, a function that shall be implemented in the future, should time permit.

Upon concluding the gas enhancement, the lead requested the addition of a temperature measurement function, a feature that was notably absent from the original requirements. I found myself somewhat vexed, as he had previously asserted that such a function could bot be implemented in version 1.0, yet now deemed it necessary.

Midday repast consisted of Chaoshou, while dinner comprised the remaining half of another baguette, accompanied by 5 egg whites. As is customary, I engaged in the practice of playing the guitar, focusing on Dragonforce's Seasons.
