On Friday, I dedicated my efforts to re-implementing the temperature measurement fitting function while simultaneously focusing on packaging a new image for the gas detector, which was slated to be sent for a test report on Saturday. Consequently, I toiled until 19:30, rendering me utterly exhausted and causing me to succumb to slumber around 21:00.

I arose from my repose around 11:00 on Saturday, indicating that I had slumbered for over 12 hours, a feat I had not accomplished in recent years. Subsequent to my awakening, I placed an order for KFC takeout. Following my midday repast, I betook myself to the gymnasium, as I had neglected to engage in physical exercise the previous day. Dinner consisted of mutton pilaf takeout, enjoyed in conjunction with playing Civilization VI.

I persisted in playing the game throughout the night, resulting in my arising at 12:00 on Sunday. Midday sustenance was curry spaghetti; dinner was procured from Dicos takeout, which I savored while luxuriating in the bathtub and immersing myself in the second season of Shangri-La Frontier.
