Last week, I frequented the gymnasium for serval consecutive days due to their impending closure for a week in observance of the Chinese New Year. I must capitalize on the opportunity to exercise to avoid encountering difficulty in recuperating after the holiday.

Moreover, I have embarked on learning to play the bass. I previously played it akin to a guitar (employing a pick). While plucking a single string is relatively straightforward, I find it considerably challenging to rapidly alternate between different strings. This difficulty lies in maintaining a consistent rhythm, as I struggle to keep a steady beats per minute (BPM) when quickly shifting between strings. Additionally, I endeavored to practice the slap technique, and making slaps generate the same volume as plucking also presents a quandary for me.

This week, I succumbed to the allure of playing Imperator: Rome, which resulted in a dearth of time for coding. This game, in its 2.x iteration, is quite commendable compared to the 1.x version I played many years prior.
