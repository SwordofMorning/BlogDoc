I felt invigorated on Wednesday morning, despite having slumbering until haf past seven. On this day, our company held a year-end soiree in the evening; consequently, I betook my self to the gymnasium to engage in the training of my dorsal musculature at noon. The dinner at the gathering was pedestrian, reminiscent of an augment version or "MR.Rice"; nevertheless, I did not sate my hunger. I perambulated home, accompanied by my erstwhile colleague, an image algorithm engineer who has been alluded to in a prior journal entry, though we continue to labor in the same enterprise presently.

I devoted my efforts to my open-source endeavor, litelog, a lightweight inter-process logging system facilitated by sockets for GNU/Linux on Thursday. The gas detector thar I have previously mentioned, which has been my primary occupation in recent month, processes an erratic auto-focus function. I rectified the AF defect on uint 1, which was engendered by program integration; these programs wew conceived to convey image data vis shared memory, but they were assimilated into a single program due to the fact that one engineer's program would exhibit latency and frame attrition through shm. Unit 3 is afflicted with the same quandary, which is precipitated by inadequate contact between the lens and the chassis.

To exacerbate matters, our UI engineers endeavored to implement novel features without rectifying extant bugs.
