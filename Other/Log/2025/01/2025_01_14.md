Despite a night fraught with tossing and turning, I managed to arise punctually. I procured a package of chicken breast to serve as my morning repast, complemented by a cup of coffee.

I dedicated my efforts to the realm of image processing, primarily focusing on achieving image differentiation. Apart from this endeavor, I indulged in a bit of "touching fish" (摸鱼), a colloquial expression for slacking off.

Midday sustenance consisted of fired rice, which exuded a homely taste, replete with copious of oil and Douban paste. Dinner was a meager affair, comprising only a few eggs. Upon comparing recent photographs with those captured a few months prior, I discerned an obvious increase in adipose tissue around my waist, leading me to conclude that it's high time to impose a modicum of control over my dietary habits. After all, the frequency of aerobic exercise has also witnessed a decline in recent moths.
